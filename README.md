# Geometric

## About

This program can be used to calculate the perimeter, area and volume of various geometric objects. At the moment you can only calculate the perimeter and area of a rectangle. More geometric objects will be implemented gradually. This is a small side project. The focus is on getting familiar with C++. Maybe the code shown here is also interesting for other programmers who want to get into C++ programming.
